# Challenge-03-RandomPasswordGenerator
A Random Password Generator powered by JavaScript to help with secure logins.

## Description

In this challenge, I modify starter code to create an application that enables the user to generate random passwords based on criteria selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. The JavaScript code will display prompts and relay events to create the randomized password.

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN I need a new, secure password
- WHEN I click the button to generate a password
- THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
- WHEN prompted for password criteria
- THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
- WHEN prompted for the length of the password
- THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
- WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
- THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
- WHEN I answer each prompt
- THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
- WHEN all prompts are answered
- THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
- WHEN the password is generated
- THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

## Work Completed

- Defined variables needed to relay events in JavaScript code
- Defined password criteria with lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and characters
- Applied JavaScript functionality to starter code pertaining to the button 'Generate Password'
- Created prompts that will guide user through password criteria
- Validated the input to ensure proper functionality of generated event and prompts
